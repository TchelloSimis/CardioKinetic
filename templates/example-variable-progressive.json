    "description": "A 4-6 week program that adapts to your available training time. Uses relative week positioning for seamless scaling between 4, 5, or 6 weeks. Starts with a foundation phase focusing on aerobic base, progresses through a development phase with increased intensity, and peaks with maximum power output. Perfect for short training blocks or fitting training around busy schedules.",
