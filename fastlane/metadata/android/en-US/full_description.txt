CardioKinetic is an open-source training app for cyclists and runners who want smarter, data-driven workouts without subscriptions or cloud accounts.

<b>Intelligent Fatigue Tracking</b>

Unlike simple training load calculators, CardioKinetic uses a dual-compartment fatigue model that separately tracks:

• <b>Metabolic fatigue (MET)</b> — Glycogen stores and CNS readiness, recovers in ~2 days
• <b>Musculoskeletal fatigue (MSK)</b> — Muscle damage and joint stress, recovers in ~15 days

This distinction matters because feeling energized doesn't mean your muscles are recovered, and vice versa.

<b>Critical Power Estimation</b>

Your aerobic ceiling (CP) and anaerobic reserve (W') are automatically calculated from your training history:

• Learns from both maximal efforts and moderate steady-state sessions
• Uses RPE proximity scoring to extract signal from every workout
• Auto-decays when you haven't tested recently

<b>Auto-Adaptive Training</b>

The app runs Monte Carlo simulations (100,000 iterations) to establish your personal fatigue baselines. When your metrics deviate, training automatically adjusts:

• Reduces power when you're stressed or fatigued
• Extends rest intervals to protect recovery
• Maintains intensity when you're fresh and primed

<b>Flexible Session Types</b>

• <b>Intervals</b> — Configurable work:rest ratios with audio cues
• <b>Steady-state</b> — Zone 2 endurance with duration progression
• <b>Custom</b> — Mix and match blocks in a single session

<b>Privacy First</b>

• No accounts required
• All data stays on your device
• Works fully offline
• GPLv3 open-source license

<b>Features</b>

• Block-based periodization with reusable training blocks
• Daily wellness questionnaire with Bayesian corrections
• Material You theming with custom accent colors
