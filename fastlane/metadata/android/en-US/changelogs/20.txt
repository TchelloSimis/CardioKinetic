This release introduces a fundamentally redesigned fatigue and readiness system with dual-compartment modeling.

New Features:
• Chronic Fatigue Model with MET (metabolic) and MSK (musculoskeletal) compartments
• Critical Power Engine that auto-estimates CP and W' from training history
• Physiological Cost Engine with W'bal-style deficit tracking
• RPE Correction Loop for model self-calibration
• Recovery Efficiency display in Training Insights
• Critical Power insights showing eCP and W' values

Improvements:
• Questionnaire now directly influences recovery calculations
• Live session UI with phase progress semicircle
• Session log UI with dynamic accent colors
• Enhanced RPE slider with gradient background

Fixes:
• Dashboard now shows MET/MSK percentages
• Monte Carlo simulation uses dual-compartment dynamics
• W' calculation validation fixes
